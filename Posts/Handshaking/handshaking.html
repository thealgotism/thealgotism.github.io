    <h1>The Handshaking Lemma (Body Count Theorem)</h1>
    <p>Here's a fun little fact for you: if you decided to add up the body counts of every human that ever existed, you would get an even number. Take a minute to think about why that might be.</p>

    <p>The reasoning goes: let's go back in time to before the first sexual encounter ever happened. Say some creep decided to keep track of the sum of everyone's body count (don't ask). For some reason he doesn't care about everyone's individual body counts, just the sum of them. Somehow, this weirdo figures out every time two people have sex (again, don't ask). And every time two people have sex, one of two things happens. Either they've already had sex before, in which case no one's body count increases. If this is their first sexual encounter, then it increases both of their individual body counts by \(1\), which means the sum of everyone's body counts has increased by \(2\).</p>

    <p>If I still haven't managed to convince you (or if you’re enjoying reading about body counts), let me walk you through a small example. Consider the first guy gang ever, we'll call them Bartholomew, Jamal, Daquavius and Ramalingam. Let's go through who does it with whom and how that affects the sum of everyone's body counts. Before anyone does anything, the sum is \(0\). Let's say Bartholomew, despite the unmoanable name, manages to take Jamal home. This adds \(1\) to both of their body counts, since Bartholomew (who told Jamal to just moan Barry) now has a body count of \(1\), and so does Jamal. Everyone else has \(0\). The sum of everyone's body counts is \(2\) as of now. Now, Jamal, being the absolute player he is, does it with both Daquavius and Ramalingam on the same night. How does this affect our sum? Jamal's body count went by \(2\) that night (whore!), while both Ramalingam's and Daquavius' body count went up by \(1\) respectively. Therefore, the sum of everyone's body counts increases by \(2 + 1 + 1 = 4\). Now, say Jamal misses the tenderness with which Bartholomew took his virginity and decides to go back to him. This doesn't improve (or make worse, depending on how you see it) anyone's body counts - they are both sleeping with someone they've already slept with. So we are still at Jamal - \(3\), Daquavius - \(1\), Barry - \(1\), Ramalingam - \(1\), and our sum is \(6\), which is still even. Now, how many ever new people join this incestuous guy gang of theirs, every time two of them have sex, either:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>They've done it before, in which case no one's body count is affected, so neither is the sum</li>
      <li>They're exploring each other for the first time (yay!), in which case both their body counts go up by \(1\), so the sum goes up by \(2\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the sum only ever goes up by \(2\) or stays the same, then the sum is always an even number!</p>

    <p>Here is a cleaner version of this theorem, after which I'll give you a more formal statement for it: Say you decide to crash a party and go around asking everyone, “Of all the people at this party right now, how many have you shaken hands with?”. Assuming everyone is sober enough to answer correctly, if you sum up everyone’s answers, you’ll get an even number. What you won’t get is invited to party with those people again, because who the fuck goes around asking people that?</p>

    <p>The reason you get an even number is because every time a handshake took place, it involved two people. Every handshake caused exactly two people’s answer to your question to be one more than it otherwise would have. And so every handshake adds \(2\) to the sum, and your answer is even.</p>

    <p>The very formal statement in graph theory is: In any finite undirected graph, the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. If you don’t know what a graph is in computer science, you can go fuck yourself. Alternatively, you can read this article(to be linked in the future) where I explain it for you. But the idea is, each edge adds \(1\) to the degree of two vertices, and so the sum of the degrees of every vertex is twice the number of edges.</p>
