      <p>Hi there! Welcome to the AlgoTism - probably the only blog you'll see trying to combine rigorous math and out-of-pocket humor...</p>
    </div> -->
    <h1>Welcome to MathHamster!</h1>
    <p>Good to see you! This probably the only blog you’ll ever see combining rigorous math with out of pocket humor - hopefully what you expected from a technical blog named after a porn website. Some openings to articles you can expect are: “Here’s a fun fact about body counts for you”, “Do all Asians really look the same?” (spoiler alert, no they don't you racist fuck), “Let’s talk about circle jerks”. Don’t worry, I somehow manage to sneak in pretty technically challenging concepts into something that starts off like that. If this sense of humor isn’t your thing (which seriously, for many people it isn’t and that’s obviously completely okay), I also have a clean version of this blog here. The content there is still engaging, still links this to the real world - I’ve just removed the dirty humor for those who it doesn’t appeal to. I believe things as technical as hardcore math can actually be fun, and I hope to convince you of that through my writing. </p>
    <h1>Where do I go from here?</h1>
    <p>You can check out my blog here. I also have articles about this blog's philosophy, where you can learn more about why I think it's a good idea to put dark humor in an article about derivatives (believe me, I actually thought this through surprisingly hard), why I think you're actually way smarter than you realize, how to learn faster (math, and in general), and much more.</p>
    <h1>You're so goddamn funny! I'm willing to pay you 100's of dollars per hour to be tutored by you!</h1>
    <p>Good news, I also tutor math (and related subjects)! For more information, see this page on my tutoring services.</p>
