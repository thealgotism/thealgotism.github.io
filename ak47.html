    <h1>You're smarter than you think</h1>
        <p>Let’s say you decide to play this game with me. There are 4 cards on the table, each of the cards has a letter of the English alphabet on one side and a number on the other side. Since the cards are on the table, you can only see one side of them. Now, I say there is a rule that the manufacturers of the cards were supposed to follow. The rule - the only rule - is that if they put a vowel on one side, then they need to put an odd number on the other side. That’s all. And to be extremely clear, vowels are the letters A, E, I, O, U and odd numbers are those that end in either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.</p>

        <p>On the table, you see the cards A, K, 4, 7. Which do you have to turn over in order to make sure that the manufacturer did their job?</p>

        <p>Take a second to think about it, and then read on to see the solution.</p>

        <p>It strikes most people that you should turn over the A. Because if there is a vowel on one side of it, there should be an odd number on the other side. Some people initially think you need to turn over the 7 (they see that it’s an odd number and assume it needs to be turned over), however, a card with Q on one side and 7 on the other is valid. The rule (which like I said, is the singular rule) was that if you have a vowel on one side, the other side needs to be odd. It doesn’t say what needs to be true if one side is odd.</p>

        <p>What doesn’t strike most people is to turn over the 4. Because if the 4 had an E on the other side, then that would be in violation.</p>

        <p>By the way, don’t worry if you got this question wrong. Most people do. And if you think this makes you stupid, read on.</p>

        <p>Now here’s an easier version to understand: You’re at a bar, and you see 4 people. One is clearly a school kid, one for sure has kids. For both of these, they’re drinking something out of a cup, but it’s not clear what they’re drinking. Then there’s two other people (who look college age, maybe they’re above 21 maybe they aren’t), one of whom you can see is just drinking water, and the other is proudly chugging beer. In order to make sure the bar hasn’t illegally served anyone alcohol, who do you need to investigate further?</p>

        <p>Almost everyone gets this right. Most people say, check what the school girl is drinking, and ID the college age kid chugging beer. The older woman can drink whatever she wants, anyone can drink water if they want.</p>

        <p>And logically, these are equivalent questions. In the second case, the rule is if drinking alcohol, must be above 21 years. In both cases, it’s If A, then you must have B. So if people are getting one wrong most of the time, and the other right most of the time, maybe raw intelligence doesn’t explain their performance on those questions.</p>

        <p>I think what’s behind this is: humans in general suck at reasoning about really abstract things. Or at least, we are way better at reasoning about things when they are concrete. I strongly believe that the reason why a lot of people struggle to digest concepts about mathematics and computer science is because they are by definition abstract. And it’s a challenge for educators to make these things concrete. Some of the things that I have taken from abstract to concrete, I’ve spent hours thinking of a way to do that. It’s not an easy task, but I do think it rewards you disproportionately.</p>

        <p>The second thing is, I really don’t think they gave a shit about whether or not you were enjoying your education or not. And I don’t really think I need to cite a study to prove this to you, but you learn much better when you are having fun. You learn better when you give a shit about what’s happening. And I always try to make that evident when I can, showing how these concepts are used in the real world.</p>

        <p>The point is that, when you take things from abstract to concrete, you understand them better. And I think this is universally true. That’s why I put so much effort into making my shit weird and funny and relevant to you. It gets your interest, makes you laugh, all very important things. But the most important thing it does is make things concrete for you. And that’s what makes me better than anyone else you’ll ever learn from.</p>
