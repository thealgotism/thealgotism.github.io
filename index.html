      Hi there! Welcome to the AlgoTism - probably the only blog you'll see trying to combine rigorous math and out-of-pocket humor. We’ll be talking about math and computer science topics that are actually pretty complicated - graphs, counting problems (combinatorics), puzzles, brain teasers, and more; except we’ll be analyzing them through my strange sense of humor. “Here’s a fun fact about body counts for you”, “Do all Asians really look the same?”, “Let’s talk about circle jerks” are some ways articles on this website start. And believe me, I somehow manage to sneak pretty technically challenging concepts into something that starts off like that. Don’t believe me? Check out some of my articles (at your own risk). If this obnoxious sense of humor isn’t your thing (which seriously, for most people it isn’t and that’s obviously okay!), I also have a clean version of this blog. The content there is still engaging, and I still have the same aim - show the “real-lifeness” in math, and keep you engaged that way. I believe math can be fun if you teach it right, and I really want to convince you of this.
