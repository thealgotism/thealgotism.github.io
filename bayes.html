    <h1>Derangements in Combinatorics (Circle Jerk Problem)</h1>
    <p>I remember back when I just started high school, dudes used to think a girl was hitting on them when the girl did the most normal shit. You’d ask the guy like “Oh, what did she do to flirt with you” and he would be like “Yeahh,,, she offered to help out with homework and even said she’d be “happy” to do that. She wants me so bad bruhhhh”. Let’s call this guy Gerard.</p>

    <p>For some reason I never quite understood, Gerard never got laid. Now, you and I aren’t incels unlike Gerard, so we understand the homework girl was for sure just being nice. Is there a mathematical calculation we can do to actually prove this, since math is the only language that geeky shits like Gerard comprehend?</p>

    <p>Let’s call the homework girl Fathima. Assume Fathima isn’t all that nice of a person, at least to people she’s not attracted to. Whenever an ugly fuck comes her way, she flips a coin in order to decide whether to be nice to them or not. In other words, she only decides to be nice \( 50\% \) or half the time to people she’s not attracted to. Now, just like you and I, Fathima is nicer to people she is crushing on. In fact, she’s on the other extreme of it. She’s always nice to people she crushes on. If she’s attracted to someone, the probability she’ll be nice to them is \( 100\% \).</p>

    <p>Now the more interesting probability. What is the probability someone is attracted to Gerard? I know it’s zero, but to prove the mathematical point here I’m going to say it’s \( 2\% \). Why? Well, some people know their worth but go on sale every once in a while. Some naive people are fooled by Gerard’s fake confidence. Some people just like autistic men. But the point is, Fathima probably doesn’t like Gerard. And that’s how society should be.</p>

    <p>Given the numbers above, if Gerard comes back to you and says he thinks Fathima likes him just because she was nice to him, what is the probability that Fathima actually likes him?</p>

    <p>Well, let’s break it down. The only thing we know is that Fathima was nice to him. And this leaves us with two possibilities:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fathima doesn’t like him but felt like being nice to Gerard that day (this is what I put my money on)</li>
        <li>Fathima likes him and that’s why she was nice to him.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let’s calculate these with my shitty handwriting:</p>

    <p>So now, we calculate these further probabilities:</p>

    <p>Now intuitively, this may surprise you a bit. You might have thought that since there is such a stark difference in how Fathima treats people she’s crushing on vs people who she isn’t, maybe Gerard actually stood a chance. And there’s a small bit of truth to it. Before we know anything about how nice Fathima was to Gerard, he only had a \( 2\% \) chance of her liking him. However, now that she decided to be nice, the probability almost doubled. So in a way, his chances got WAY better since Fathima was nice to him.</p>

    <p>The problem is, Gerard is so hideous that even after doubling his chances, he’s still at a meager \( 4\% \) chance of getting with Fathima. It's sad, but it’s what that little shit deserves.</p>
